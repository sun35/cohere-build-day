RAG **enables the language model to produce more informed, accurate, and contextually relevant answers** than by relying on its pre-trained knowledge alone.\n",

        "- Step 1: Indexing and given a user query, retrieve the relevant chunks from the index\n",

Hundreds of the world’s leading brands — including HSBC, Chipotle, and Virgin Media — use the company’s Conversational Cloud platform to engage with millions of consumers safely and responsibly. LivePerson powers a billion conversational interactions every month, providing a uniquely rich data set and safety tools to unlock the power of generative AI and large language models for better business outcomes. Fast Company named LivePerson the #1 Most Innovative AI Company in the world.\\n\\nToday’s messaging-based customer support is lightyears away from the web chat experience of the past. Thanks to advancements in generative AI powered by large language models (LLMs), customers can interact with automated systems in a way that feels natural, dynamic, and human. LLMs can also enable systems to go beyond answering questions and take specific actions on behalf of customers.\\n\\nSince 1995,LivePersonhas been at the forefront of this evolution, and in recent years, the company has focused on conversational AI solutions for a range of use cases, including customer support, commerce, sales and marketing, and IT service management. Hundreds of the world’s leading brands use LivePerson’s leading Conversational Cloud platform to engage with millions of customers through safe and sophisticated automated conversations.\\n\\nAs they build the next generation of conversational AI solutions,LivePerson’s engineering team is working with Cohere as a co-innovation partnerto help level up the accuracy, quality, and groundedness of the conversational experience.\\n\\n\\nAs a leader in conversational AI solutions, LivePerson wanted to capitalize on the latest LLM advancements to help the company move faster toward its goal of automating the world’s business conversations at scale.\\n\\nSo, the company began looking to partner with an LLM provider to help them do so. “We wanted a partner that had substantial expertise in the LLM space,” recalls Joe Bradley, Chief Scientist at LivePerson, “and was willing to solve problems with us, so that they, in turn, could learn and grow their own offerings.”\\n\\nCohere was at the top of the list due to its industry reputation. “The partnership offered high-quality LLMs that are well respected in the field, along with technical support,” says Bradley. “Cohere was willing to engage with us at a much deeper level than other providers, and experiment with us to learn what strategies work in our context.”\\n\\nIn terms of partnership goals, Bradley and team wanted to learn how to keep LLM-powered conversations grounded, factual, and “on the rails,” generating outputs that match enterprise needs in real-life use cases. They also wanted Cohere’s help with training models to enable systems to take specific actions or complete a task.\\n\\n\\n\\nBradley’s team began working with Cohere to improve LivePerson’s own tech support conversational AI system. He says, “The tech support use case is a very sturdy test for LLMs because we’ve got all this conversational data to draw from, and the system needs to provide useful guidance to people about a complicated product. And the results so far have been impressive. Cohere’s models are standing up really well against the big third-party APIs, and they are tuned by real conversational data for our tech support use case, rather than being generic.”\\n\\nThe team trained Cohere models on LivePerson’s own data, and then tested the output with the company’s human contact center agents. “We can train the models more deeply in concert with Cohere than we can with some of the open APIs,” says Bradley.\\n\\nWhen fine-tuning theCohere Commandcore model, Bradley’s team followed a “relaxed training” paradigm and interleaved other data into their dataset in order to avoid overfitting on specific tasks. This enabled the model to maintain its general reasoning capabilities. “Cohere allows us to experiment with paradigms like that that give us the best of both worlds,” he says.\\n\\nThe collaboration has also resulted in some feature improvements. For example, when a customer asks the bot a question, it’s important that the bot pulls the right information from the knowledge base. The team worked with Cohere onre-rankingsearch results from their knowledge base, and then weaving the ranked results into a broader prompt for the LLM to generate an answer to the customer. “It’s not easy to do well, but they did a really nice job. It helped performance and made quite an impact,” says Bradley.\\n\\n\\nLivePerson tech support is now using Cohere models in production, and the team has shifted to working with Cohere on several key use cases for banking and e-commerce clients, including automating specific actions during a conversation. These are currently in the experimental phase, and so far it’s going well. “The Cohere models for banking are performing, again, with very high quality,” Bradley says. “They tend to generate more succinct output than other models, which makes them well-suited for task-based conversations. They are more likely to be factually correct and well-grounded without overindulging themselves in their own language.”LivePerson is also exploring new opportunities for using LLMs in other enterprise AI use cases, such as HR, IT, and industry-specific workflows, for automated customer and employee support. For example, AI assistants can help bank tellers check policy or regulatory requirements, or give sales people quick access to product and service details.For LivePerson’s customer brands, the impact of LLM-powered conversational solutions is massive. Not only does it result in happier customers and employees, but it also allows brands to automate more workflows, save on operational costs, and optimize resources by focusing human staff on higher-value tasks.\\n“Cohere’s models are standing up really well against the big third-party APIs, and they are tuned by real conversational data for our tech support use case, rather than being generic.”\\nREADY TO GET STARTED?\\nCreate an account and build with Cohere\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nDiscord\\nEmail\\n©Cohere2024', 'description': 'As co-innovation partner, Cohere levels up conversation quality.'}, {'url': 'https://cohere.com/privacy', 'title': 'Privacy Policy | Cohere', 'body': 'Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nLast Update: May 7, 2024\\nCohere Inc.

Combining human and artificial intelligence to track the activity of hundreds of infectious diseases and syndromes worldwide, it applies academic data science and deep subject matter expertise to anticipate global spread and impact. Founded in 2013 and used by the City of Chicago, Taiwan CDC, Air Canada, and more, BlueDot helps clients make critical decisions with clarity and confidence.\\n\\nInfectious diseases pose a growing global threat, as evidenced by recent outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic, the mpox global public health emergency, and an expanding number of avian influenza outbreaks. To prevent health, economic, and social disruption from outbreaks, public and private sector organizations need access to unbiased, accurate, real-time, and global intelligence about disease threats. For more than a decade,BlueDothas generated and disseminated such intelligence through its technology platform. However, until now, it was only accessible via complex API calls tailored to data engineers and data scientists.\\n\\nBlueDot sought to make its insights more accessible and timely while ensuring the highest level of accuracy. Using the fine-tunedCohere ClassifyandCohere Reranksolutions, BlueDot created an interactive platform that makes infectious disease intelligence available to users through natural language.\\n\\nPreviously, tapping into BlueDot’s real-time, infectious disease surveillance data and intelligence required significant technical expertise. Users had to understand which of BlueDot’s many API endpoints – including real-time reports of disease cases, disease spread forecasts, and more – to leverage and structure programmatic calls to the API. This limited adoption to skilled data scientists, engineers, and epidemiologists, creating delays in insight generation and ultimately, real-world action. Dr. Kamran Khan, CEO of BlueDot, explains, “By reducing the technical barriers to interact with a diverse array of complex global data, almost anyone can now generate powerful insights in just a matter of seconds.”\\n\\nBlueDot’s vision was to create a highly accesible solution that empowers users to ask questions in plain language and receive accurate responses instantly. However, translating intricate data queries into precise API calls presented a significant challenge. Initial trials with embedding techniques proved inadequate, failing to discern the subtleties between queries, such as “COVID cases in Italy” and “disease outbreaks in Italy.” To preserve the integrity of insights and client trust, BlueDot needed a system that consistently and reliably identified the most appropriate API endpoint for every user query made in natural language.\\n\\nBlueDot first experimented with embedding-based techniques, but this failed to achieve the necessary level of accuracy, delivering less than a 50% match rate. Then, the BlueDot team found their answer with Cohere, using a fine-tunedCohere ClassifyandCohere Rerank. In production, these endpoints to the Cohere API work in tandem with impressive, low-latency query processing in milliseconds.\\n\\nA fine-tuned Classify first retrieves a list of candidate API endpoints based on the query, then Rerank reorders the candidates to prioritize the most relevant ones. According to BlueDot’s Machine Learning Engineer Nick Gibb, “The integration of Cohere’s technology marked a significant leap in performance. The right endpoint now appears more than 97% of the time.”\\n\\nThis level of accuracy was unachievable with other approaches. This new system captures subtle linguistic nuances that were overlooked by basic embedding techniques, with fast and affordable implementation compared to developing a similar in-house solution. Nick Gibb explains, “Cohere\\'s fine-tuned models were easy to test, going live in less than an hour.”\\n\\nEfforts are ongoing to further refine the system, targeting perfect 100% accuracy. BlueDot employs an evaluation protocol that rigorously assesses the accuracy of fine-tuned Classify and Rerank solutions. This protocol makes sure that the system consistently interprets user queries correctly and reliably directs them to the right data source for accurate responses. It confirms that the system understands user questions well enough to connect them to the data that is needed.\\n\\nA dedicated team handled the Cohere integration, including\\xa0 four software engineers, one product owner, and one product designer. The new system uses BlueDot\\'s data assets, curated and maintained by infectious disease epidemiologists, clinicians, veterinarians, and data scientists.\\n\\nWith Cohere’s custom models in place, BlueDot launched its initial beta trial with its public and private sector clients. BlueDot’s CEO, Dr. Khan noted, “BlueDot’s intelligence informs decisions that impact millions of lives worldwide. This is why our approach to AI development is so rigorous. Cohere is a key partner in helping us make our intelligence more accessible through natural language, while ensuring users are empowered with the specific data they need.\"\\n\\nBy removing technical barriers, BlueDot now enables faster, more effective, and better coordinated organizational responses to global infectious disease threats. Public health agencies, life sciences companies, multinational enterprises, and more can now monitor global threats, understand them faster, and take appropriate actions sooner. What once took days to generate actionable insights now takes minutes, thanks to the broader access to BlueDot’s global intelligence through natural language.\\n\\n\\nCohere remains a valued partner as BlueDot advances the natural language interface to handle multi-turn conversations and queries requiring orchestration across multiple endpoints. Together, BlueDot and Cohere are driving transformational change in how organizations combat, prepare for, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks worldwide.\\n\\n\"Cohere is a key partner in helping us make our intelligence more accessible through natural language, while ensuring users are empowered with the specific data they need.\"\\nREADY TO GET STARTED?\\nCreate an account and build with Cohere\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nDiscord\\nEmail\\n©Cohere2024', 'description': 'Using the fine-tuned Cohere Classify and Cohere Rerank solutions, BlueDot created an interactive platform that makes infectious disease intelligence available to users through natural language.'}, {'url': 'https://cohere.com/security', 'title': 'Security - Protecting Your Data | Cohere', 'body': 'Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nWe have an Information Security Program in place that is communicated throughout the organization.

Based in New York City, the team at Otherside AI is dedicated to creating technology that helps the world communicate more effectively. Follow them on Twitter and YouTube, or join the discussion in their Discord community.\\n\\nToday, the blank page is a thing of the past. Generative AI startups are building new and innovative ways to help writers of all kinds create the content they need to achieve their goals. One such pioneer isHyperWrite, a generative AI-powered writing assistant for consumers that makes the process easy and fast.HyperWrite adds autocomplete capabilities to websites and apps, providing users with ideas and suggestions as they type. HyperWrite also enables users to enter prompts and generate complete copy for longer pieces, such as emails, blog posts, business memos, and more.When choosing an LLM for their TypeAhead feature, the HyperWrite team considered several commercial and open-source solutions, as well as building their own. In the end, they chose Cohere’s generative LLM due to its high quality, low latency, and affordability.\\n\\nTo deliver the best possible writing assistant, the startup wanted to build an interface that enabled the average person to interact with, and get value from, large language models (LLMs).The team considered a variety of approaches to integrating LLMs into the HyperWrite platform, including building their own models from scratch or customizing an open-source solution. Matt Shumer, CEO and Co-Founder, says, “There are so many options out there, but at the end of the day, our first priority is our customers. By working with a managed solution like Cohere, we're able to focus our entire effort on our customers — understanding what they need, and building and iterating that for them.”The company tried working with a few managed generative AI solutions before finally settling on Cohere for the long term. The deciding factors: accuracy, affordability, and great support. Shumer says, “Cohere’s models are amazing. The company excels at delivering cost-effective, low-latency, medium-sized models that are high-quality, which enables us to build some of our most difficult-to-implement features that can deliver excellent performance.”\\n\\nHyperWrite is using Cohere’s Command-Light model, which is a great fit for their product. It provides the perfect balance between speed and accuracy, enabling users to generate the output they expected within seconds, whether in the planning, drafting, editing, or iterating process with their piece. When it comes to mitigating risk, Shumer is confident with his team’s approach. “Safety is a reasonable concern, but today’s LLMs have come a long way. Two years ago, you had no clue about what might come out of a model. Now, you have a good sense of how the model will behave.” HyperWrite also uses filtering technology built for social media, adding multiple layers of filters on top of their outputs. Text is not shown to the user until it’s checked, approved, and cleared.So far, Shumer and team have seen very few problems, even with hundreds of thousands of monthly users. He said, “A lot of companies become too risk averse because they don’t realize that it’s possible to constrain things. Our approach has worked well for us and it’s also been easy to implement.”During development, the Cohere team provided valuable technical support that helped the HyperWrite team achieve their goals. When they experienced problems or needed help figuring out a use case, Cohere expertise was right there for them. “That’s a superpower,” said Shumer. “Having Cohere’s team as an extension of ours enables us to do 10 times more, 10 times faster. They’re responsive over Slack, and always willing to try to push through boundaries for us.”\\n\\nHyperWrite is currently in hyper-growth mode, and the pace has been remarkable. “We’re actually outpacing our previous growth percentages and doubling our business every two months,” said Shumer. “And week after week, Cohere enables us to continue delivering at this ever-increasing scale, both from a platform and support perspective. We've worked with a number of vendors, and there's a clear difference in the quality of Cohere’s support, their ability to assist us and help us grow.”By removing the challenges of building their own solution, Cohere enables the startup to do more of what they do best and not worry about things outside of that. “Our entire business is language AI-first,” said Shumer. “It’s one of the most important functions we have to get right. It’s also quite complex and difficult to do, so managed solutions like Cohere help us implement language AI at a reasonable cost and with high quality.”\\n\\nWatchour full interviewwith Matt Shumer to hear more of the HyperWrite story.\\n“Cohere’s models are amazing.

The company is dedicated to pioneering a better way to write on the web for those whose work depends on building connections. Follow the Flowrite team onTwitterandLinkedIn, or read more about writing, productivity, and the startup journey on theirblog.\\nWriting takes time, effort, and focus — all of which can be hard to muster on any given day. Busy people often don’t have the bandwidth to craft thoughtful communications that help them stay connected and productive. EnterFlowrite, a generative AI platform that helps people stay on top of their communications backlog by drafting emails and messages for them across their web browser.\\nFlowrite is purposely designed for frequent and responsive email and messaging workflows, offering a broad collection of smart email templates for sales, marketing, recruiting, support, and other use cases. But Flowrite is not only for business use; customers also use the service to communicate with friends and family.\\n\\nUnder the hood, Flowrite uses large language models (LLMs) to power its text generation capabilities, and from the beginning, the startup took the managed LLM approach. “We didn’t have the budget for building a model in-house, and we didn’t want to manage the infrastructure,” recalls Bernardo García del Río, AI Lead at Flowrite. “Using an API instead of building and deploying our own model was the most sensible path at that time, and it still makes sense for us.”\\nFlowrite was originally built using OpenAI models, and the AI team was looking to expand their stack to include other LLM solutions in order to boost reliability and unlock new opportunities. They also wanted greater data security for enterprise customers, as well as access to expert technical support to help them achieve their goals faster.\\nGarcía says, “We've been monitoring the LLM landscape from the very beginning, and we thought that Cohere was a clear competitor to OpenAI. And that's why we wanted to start to form a partnership early in the journey.” Not only did Cohere’s models perform well against OpenAI, and in addition, Cohere’s Accelerator program offered the startup access to technical expertise for tailored guidance and support.\\n\\nFlowrite’s primary use case for Cohere was copy generation, and the AI team proceeded to run Cohere’sCommand modelthrough their testing process, focusing on prompt engineering backed by real data to test models for specific tasks. The team looked at a mix of data points from user activity, along with visual output comparison by linguistics experts and company-wide testing. After conducting extensive testing with Command, the AI team was happy with the results and began actively working towards adding it to their production stack.Flowrite has also used Cohere to help them prepare adiverse datasetin order to be able to generate content for a diverse range of topics. The AI team used Cohere'sembeddings modelto cluster data and evaluate the level of diversity of their dataset, so it could help them effectively fine-tune their models and improve latency and quality. “And the results were really good to be honest,” says García. “We found that using Cohere to calculate the distance between the vectors resulted in better clusters compared to OpenAI.”To support these use cases, and more to come, Flowrite relies on Cohere’s technical expertise available through theCohere Accelerator program. Flowrite was one of the first startups to join the program and, in fact, their early feedback helped to shape it.As members, the team can reach out for support anytime on Slack, and gain early access to Beta releases, which helps them plan their roadmap. They also appreciate being closer to Cohere in a collaborative environment where they can give real-world feedback on Cohere products and features. And when Flowrite needs to scale in future, having a good partnership will help the company grow more easily.\\nFor García and his team, getting hands-on with Cohere has been a great experience overall. “Cohere is really easy and straightforward to use,” he says, “In four or five lines of code, you’re generating an email. Cohere is also integrated into popular frameworks like LangChain, as well as the ChromaDB vector database that can automatically create embeddings. It makes things really efficient.”Once testing is complete and the AI team has developed prompts that work well for Cohere, they plan to ship Cohere’s generative models to production. At that point, it will just be a matter of changing a little bit of code. As Flowrite grows its user base of consumers and businesses, they’ll be able to continuously gather more data to further improve model performance across their LLM portfolio.\\n“We've been monitoring the LLM landscape from the very beginning, and we thought that Cohere was a clear competitor to OpenAI.

              "  'body': 'Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nLivePerson is a global leader in trustworthy and equal AI for business. Hundreds of the world’s leading brands — including HSBC, Chipotle, and Virgin Media — use the company’s Conversational Cloud platform to engage with millions of consumers safely and responsibly. LivePerson powers a billion conversational interactions every month, providing a uniquely rich data set and safety tools to unlock the power of generative AI and large language models for better business outcomes. Fast Company named LivePerson the #1 Most Innovative AI Company in the world.\\n\\nToday’s messaging-based customer support is lightyears away from the web chat experience of the past. Thanks to advancements in generative AI powered by large language models (LLMs), customers can interact with automated systems in a way that feels natural, dynamic, and human. LLMs can also enable systems to go beyond answering questions and take specific actions on behalf of customers.\\n\\nSince 1995,LivePersonhas been at the forefront of this evolution, and in recent years, the company has focused on conversational AI solutions for a range of use cases, including customer support, commerce, sales and marketing, and IT service management. Hundreds of the world’s leading brands use LivePerson’s leading Conversational Cloud platform to engage with millions of customers through safe and sophisticated automated conversations.\\n\\nAs they build the next generation of conversational AI solutions,LivePerson’s engineering team is working with Cohere as a co-innovation partnerto help level up the accuracy, quality, and groundedness of the conversational experience.\\n\\n\\nAs a leader in conversational AI solutions, LivePerson wanted to capitalize on the latest LLM advancements to help the company move faster toward its goal of automating the world’s business conversations at scale.\\n\\nSo, the company began looking to partner with an LLM provider to help them do so. “We wanted a partner that had substantial expertise in the LLM space,” recalls Joe Bradley, Chief Scientist at LivePerson, “and was willing to solve problems with us, so that they, in turn, could learn and grow their own offerings.”\\n\\nCohere was at the top of the list due to its industry reputation. “The partnership offered high-quality LLMs that are well respected in the field, along with technical support,” says Bradley. “Cohere was willing to engage with us at a much deeper level than other providers, and experiment with us to learn what strategies work in our context.”\\n\\nIn terms of partnership goals, Bradley and team wanted to learn how to keep LLM-powered conversations grounded, factual, and “on the rails,” generating outputs that match enterprise needs in real-life use cases. They also wanted Cohere’s help with training models to enable systems to take specific actions or complete a task.\\n\\n\\n\\nBradley’s team began working with Cohere to improve LivePerson’s own tech support conversational AI system. He says, “The tech support use case is a very sturdy test for LLMs because we’ve got all this conversational data to draw from, and the system needs to provide useful guidance to people about a complicated product. And the results so far have been impressive. Cohere’s models are standing up really well against the big third-party APIs, and they are tuned by real conversational data for our tech support use case, rather than being generic.”\\n\\nThe team trained Cohere models on LivePerson’s own data, and then tested the output with the company’s human contact center agents. “We can train the models more deeply in concert with Cohere than we can with some of the open APIs,” says Bradley.\\n\\nWhen fine-tuning theCohere Commandcore model, Bradley’s team followed a “relaxed training” paradigm and interleaved other data into their dataset in order to avoid overfitting on specific tasks. This enabled the model to maintain its general reasoning capabilities. “Cohere allows us to experiment with paradigms like that that give us the best of both worlds,” he says.\\n\\nThe collaboration has also resulted in some feature improvements. For example, when a customer asks the bot a question, it’s important that the bot pulls the right information from the knowledge base. The team worked with Cohere onre-rankingsearch results from their knowledge base, and then weaving the ranked results into a broader prompt for the LLM to generate an answer to the customer. “It’s not easy to do well, but they did a really nice job. It helped performance and made quite an impact,” says Bradley.\\n\\n\\nLivePerson tech support is now using Cohere models in production, and the team has shifted to working with Cohere on several key use cases for banking and e-commerce clients, including automating specific actions during a conversation. These are currently in the experimental phase, and so far it’s going well. “The Cohere models for banking are performing, again, with very high quality,” Bradley says. “They tend to generate more succinct output than other models, which makes them well-suited for task-based conversations. They are more likely to be factually correct and well-grounded without overindulging themselves in their own language.”LivePerson is also exploring new opportunities for using LLMs in other enterprise AI use cases, such as HR, IT, and industry-specific workflows, for automated customer and employee support.

              "  'title': 'BlueDot Fights Disease Outbreaks with AI-Powered Intelligence | Cohere',\n",
              "  'body': 'Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nBlueDot’s intelligence platform empowers public and private sector organizations to rapidly identify, understand, and effectively respond to global infectious disease threats. Combining human and artificial intelligence to track the activity of hundreds of infectious diseases and syndromes worldwide, it applies academic data science and deep subject matter expertise to anticipate global spread and impact. Founded in 2013 and used by the City of Chicago, Taiwan CDC, Air Canada, and more, BlueDot helps clients make critical decisions with clarity and confidence.\\n\\nInfectious diseases pose a growing global threat, as evidenced by recent outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic, the mpox global public health emergency, and an expanding number of avian influenza outbreaks. To prevent health, economic, and social disruption from outbreaks, public and private sector organizations need access to unbiased, accurate, real-time, and global intelligence about disease threats. For more than a decade,BlueDothas generated and disseminated such intelligence through its technology platform. However, until now, it was only accessible via complex API calls tailored to data engineers and data scientists.\\n\\nBlueDot sought to make its insights more accessible and timely while ensuring the highest level of accuracy. Using the fine-tunedCohere ClassifyandCohere Reranksolutions, BlueDot created an interactive platform that makes infectious disease intelligence available to users through natural language.\\n\\nPreviously, tapping into BlueDot’s real-time, infectious disease surveillance data and intelligence required significant technical expertise. Users had to understand which of BlueDot’s many API endpoints – including real-time reports of disease cases, disease spread forecasts, and more – to leverage and structure programmatic calls to the API. This limited adoption to skilled data scientists, engineers, and epidemiologists, creating delays in insight generation and ultimately, real-world action. Dr. Kamran Khan, CEO of BlueDot, explains, “By reducing the technical barriers to interact with a diverse array of complex global data, almost anyone can now generate powerful insights in just a matter of seconds.”\\n\\nBlueDot’s vision was to create a highly accesible solution that empowers users to ask questions in plain language and receive accurate responses instantly. However, translating intricate data queries into precise API calls presented a significant challenge. Initial trials with embedding techniques proved inadequate, failing to discern the subtleties between queries, such as “COVID cases in Italy” and “disease outbreaks in Italy.” To preserve the integrity of insights and client trust, BlueDot needed a system that consistently and reliably identified the most appropriate API endpoint for every user query made in natural language.\\n\\nBlueDot first experimented with embedding-based techniques, but this failed to achieve the necessary level of accuracy, delivering less than a 50% match rate. Then, the BlueDot team found their answer with Cohere, using a fine-tunedCohere ClassifyandCohere Rerank. In production, these endpoints to the Cohere API work in tandem with impressive, low-latency query processing in milliseconds.\\n\\nA fine-tuned Classify first retrieves a list of candidate API endpoints based on the query, then Rerank reorders the candidates to prioritize the most relevant ones. According to BlueDot’s Machine Learning Engineer Nick Gibb, “The integration of Cohere’s technology marked a significant leap in performance. The right endpoint now appears more than 97% of the time.”\\n\\nThis level of accuracy was unachievable with other approaches. This new system captures subtle linguistic nuances that were overlooked by basic embedding techniques, with fast and affordable implementation compared to developing a similar in-house solution. Nick Gibb explains, “Cohere\\'s fine-tuned models were easy to test, going live in less than an hour.”\\n\\nEfforts are ongoing to further refine the system, targeting perfect 100% accuracy. BlueDot employs an evaluation protocol that rigorously assesses the accuracy of fine-tuned Classify and Rerank solutions. This protocol makes sure that the system consistently interprets user queries correctly and reliably directs them to the right data source for accurate responses. It confirms that the system understands user questions well enough to connect them to the data that is needed.\\n\\nA dedicated team handled the Cohere integration, including\\xa0 four software engineers, one product owner, and one product designer. The new system uses BlueDot\\'s data assets, curated and maintained by infectious disease epidemiologists, clinicians, veterinarians, and data scientists.\\n\\nWith Cohere’s custom models in place, BlueDot launched its initial beta trial with its public and private sector clients. BlueDot’s CEO, Dr. Khan noted, “BlueDot’s intelligence informs decisions that impact millions of lives worldwide. This is why our approach to AI development is so rigorous. Cohere is a key partner in helping us make our intelligence more accessible through natural language, while ensuring users are empowered with the specific data they need.\"\\n\\nBy removing technical barriers, BlueDot now enables faster, more effective, and better coordinated organizational responses to global infectious disease threats. Public health agencies, life sciences companies, multinational enterprises, and more can now monitor global threats, understand them faster, and take appropriate actions sooner. What once took days to generate actionable insights now takes minutes, thanks to the broader access to BlueDot’s global intelligence through natural language.\\n\\n\\nCohere remains a valued partner as BlueDot advances the natural language interface to handle multi-turn conversations and queries requiring orchestration across multiple endpoints. Together, BlueDot and Cohere are driving transformational change in how organizations combat, prepare for, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks worldwide.\\n\\n\"Cohere is a key partner in helping us make our intelligence more accessible through natural language, while ensuring users are empowered with the specific data they need.\"\\nREADY TO GET STARTED?\\nCreate an account and build with Cohere\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nDiscord\\nEmail\\n©Cohere2024',\n",

              "  'body': \"Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nHyperWrite is a product of Otherside AI. Based in New York City, the team at Otherside AI is dedicated to creating technology that helps the world communicate more effectively. Follow them on Twitter and YouTube, or join the discussion in their Discord community.\\n\\nToday, the blank page is a thing of the past. Generative AI startups are building new and innovative ways to help writers of all kinds create the content they need to achieve their goals. One such pioneer isHyperWrite, a generative AI-powered writing assistant for consumers that makes the process easy and fast.HyperWrite adds autocomplete capabilities to websites and apps, providing users with ideas and suggestions as they type. HyperWrite also enables users to enter prompts and generate complete copy for longer pieces, such as emails, blog posts, business memos, and more.When choosing an LLM for their TypeAhead feature, the HyperWrite team considered several commercial and open-source solutions, as well as building their own. In the end, they chose Cohere’s generative LLM due to its high quality, low latency, and affordability.\\n\\nTo deliver the best possible writing assistant, the startup wanted to build an interface that enabled the average person to interact with, and get value from, large language models (LLMs).The team considered a variety of approaches to integrating LLMs into the HyperWrite platform, including building their own models from scratch or customizing an open-source solution. Matt Shumer, CEO and Co-Founder, says, “There are so many options out there, but at the end of the day, our first priority is our customers. By working with a managed solution like Cohere, we're able to focus our entire effort on our customers — understanding what they need, and building and iterating that for them.”The company tried working with a few managed generative AI solutions before finally settling on Cohere for the long term. The deciding factors: accuracy, affordability, and great support. Shumer says, “Cohere’s models are amazing. The company excels at delivering cost-effective, low-latency, medium-sized models that are high-quality, which enables us to build some of our most difficult-to-implement features that can deliver excellent performance.”\\n\\nHyperWrite is using Cohere’s Command-Light model, which is a great fit for their product. It provides the perfect balance between speed and accuracy, enabling users to generate the output they expected within seconds, whether in the planning, drafting, editing, or iterating process with their piece. When it comes to mitigating risk, Shumer is confident with his team’s approach. “Safety is a reasonable concern, but today’s LLMs have come a long way. Two years ago, you had no clue about what might come out of a model. Now, you have a good sense of how the model will behave.” HyperWrite also uses filtering technology built for social media, adding multiple layers of filters on top of their outputs. Text is not shown to the user until it’s checked, approved, and cleared.So far, Shumer and team have seen very few problems, even with hundreds of thousands of monthly users. He said, “A lot of companies become too risk averse because they don’t realize that it’s possible to constrain things. Our approach has worked well for us and it’s also been easy to implement.”During development, the Cohere team provided valuable technical support that helped the HyperWrite team achieve their goals. When they experienced problems or needed help figuring out a use case, Cohere expertise was right there for them. “That’s a superpower,” said Shumer. “Having Cohere’s team as an extension of ours enables us to do 10 times more, 10 times faster. They’re responsive over Slack, and always willing to try to push through boundaries for us.”\\n\\nHyperWrite is currently in hyper-growth mode, and the pace has been remarkable. “We’re actually outpacing our previous growth percentages and doubling our business every two months,” said Shumer. “And week after week, Cohere enables us to continue delivering at this ever-increasing scale, both from a platform and support perspective. We've worked with a number of vendors, and there's a clear difference in the quality of Cohere’s support, their ability to assist us and help us grow.”By removing the challenges of building their own solution, Cohere enables the startup to do more of what they do best and not worry about things outside of that. “Our entire business is language AI-first,” said Shumer. “It’s one of the most important functions we have to get right. It’s also quite complex and difficult to do, so managed solutions like Cohere help us implement language AI at a reasonable cost and with high quality.”\\n\\nWatchour full interviewwith Matt Shumer to hear more of the HyperWrite story.\\n“Cohere’s models are amazing.

              "  'body': \"Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nFlowrite is a communications platform that uses generative AI to automate copywriting for emails and messages. The company is dedicated to pioneering a better way to write on the web for those whose work depends on building connections. Follow the Flowrite team onTwitterandLinkedIn, or read more about writing, productivity, and the startup journey on theirblog.\\nWriting takes time, effort, and focus — all of which can be hard to muster on any given day. Busy people often don’t have the bandwidth to craft thoughtful communications that help them stay connected and productive. EnterFlowrite, a generative AI platform that helps people stay on top of their communications backlog by drafting emails and messages for them across their web browser.\\nFlowrite is purposely designed for frequent and responsive email and messaging workflows, offering a broad collection of smart email templates for sales, marketing, recruiting, support, and other use cases. But Flowrite is not only for business use; customers also use the service to communicate with friends and family.\\n\\nUnder the hood, Flowrite uses large language models (LLMs) to power its text generation capabilities, and from the beginning, the startup took the managed LLM approach. “We didn’t have the budget for building a model in-house, and we didn’t want to manage the infrastructure,” recalls Bernardo García del Río, AI Lead at Flowrite. “Using an API instead of building and deploying our own model was the most sensible path at that time, and it still makes sense for us.”\\nFlowrite was originally built using OpenAI models, and the AI team was looking to expand their stack to include other LLM solutions in order to boost reliability and unlock new opportunities. They also wanted greater data security for enterprise customers, as well as access to expert technical support to help them achieve their goals faster.\\nGarcía says, “We've been monitoring the LLM landscape from the very beginning, and we thought that Cohere was a clear competitor to OpenAI. And that's why we wanted to start to form a partnership early in the journey.” Not only did Cohere’s models perform well against OpenAI, and in addition, Cohere’s Accelerator program offered the startup access to technical expertise for tailored guidance and support.\\n\\nFlowrite’s primary use case for Cohere was copy generation, and the AI team proceeded to run Cohere’sCommand modelthrough their testing process, focusing on prompt engineering backed by real data to test models for specific tasks. The team looked at a mix of data points from user activity, along with visual output comparison by linguistics experts and company-wide testing. After conducting extensive testing with Command, the AI team was happy with the results and began actively working towards adding it to their production stack.Flowrite has also used Cohere to help them prepare adiverse datasetin order to be able to generate content for a diverse range of topics. The AI team used Cohere'sembeddings modelto cluster data and evaluate the level of diversity of their dataset, so it could help them effectively fine-tune their models and improve latency and quality. “And the results were really good to be honest,” says García. “We found that using Cohere to calculate the distance between the vectors resulted in better clusters compared to OpenAI.”To support these use cases, and more to come, Flowrite relies on Cohere’s technical expertise available through theCohere Accelerator program. Flowrite was one of the first startups to join the program and, in fact, their early feedback helped to shape it.As members, the team can reach out for support anytime on Slack, and gain early access to Beta releases, which helps them plan their roadmap. They also appreciate being closer to Cohere in a collaborative environment where they can give real-world feedback on Cohere products and features. And when Flowrite needs to scale in future, having a good partnership will help the company grow more easily.\\nFor García and his team, getting hands-on with Cohere has been a great experience overall. “Cohere is really easy and straightforward to use,” he says, “In four or five lines of code, you’re generating an email. Cohere is also integrated into popular frameworks like LangChain, as well as the ChromaDB vector database that can automatically create embeddings. It makes things really efficient.”Once testing is complete and the AI team has developed prompts that work well for Cohere, they plan to ship Cohere’s generative models to production. At that point, it will just be a matter of changing a little bit of code. As Flowrite grows its user base of consumers and businesses, they’ll be able to continuously gather more data to further improve model performance across their LLM portfolio.\\n“We've been monitoring the LLM landscape from the very beginning, and we thought that Cohere was a clear competitor to OpenAI. And that's why we wanted to start to form a partnership early in the journey.”\\nREADY TO GET STARTED?\\nCreate an account and build with Cohere\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nDiscord\\nEmail\\n©Cohere2024\",\n",

We've also established an advisory Responsibility Council empowered to inform our product and business decisions.\\nWe are excited about the potential for algorithmic language understanding to improve accessibility, enable human computer interaction, and allow for broader human-to-human dialogue.

This requires anticipating and accounting for risks during our development process. We run adversarial attacks, filter our training data for harmful text, and measure our models against safety research benchmarks. We also evaluate evolving risks with monitoring tools designed to identify harmful model outputs.We recognize that misuse of powerful language models will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable, so we aim to balance safety considerations and equity of access. This is an ongoing process.

              " 'Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nLivePerson is a global leader in trustworthy and equal AI for business. Hundreds of the world’s leading brands — including HSBC, Chipotle, and Virgin Media — use the company’s Conversational Cloud platform to engage with millions of consumers safely and responsibly. LivePerson powers a billion conversational interactions every month, providing a uniquely rich data set and safety tools to unlock the power of generative AI and large language models for better business outcomes. Fast Company named LivePerson the #1 Most Innovative AI Company in the world.\\n\\nToday’s messaging-based customer support is lightyears away from the web chat experience of the past. Thanks to advancements in generative AI powered by large language models (LLMs), customers can interact with automated systems in a way that feels natural, dynamic, and human. LLMs can also enable systems to go beyond answering questions and take specific actions on behalf of customers.\\n\\nSince 1995,LivePersonhas been at the forefront of this evolution, and in recent years, the company has focused on conversational AI solutions for a range of use cases, including customer support, commerce, sales and marketing, and IT service management. Hundreds of the world’s leading brands use LivePerson’s leading Conversational Cloud platform to engage with millions of customers through safe and sophisticated automated conversations.\\n\\nAs they build the next generation of conversational AI solutions,LivePerson’s engineering team is working with Cohere as a co-innovation partnerto help level up the accuracy, quality, and groundedness of the conversational experience.\\n\\n\\nAs a leader in conversational AI solutions, LivePerson wanted to capitalize on the latest LLM advancements to help the company move faster toward its goal of automating the world’s business conversations at scale.\\n\\nSo, the company began looking to partner with an LLM provider to help them do so. “We wanted a partner that had substantial expertise in the LLM space,” recalls Joe Bradley, Chief Scientist at LivePerson, “and was willing to solve problems with us, so that they, in turn, could learn and grow their own offerings.”\\n\\nCohere was at the top of the list due to its industry reputation. “The partnership offered high-quality LLMs that are well respected in the field, along with technical support,” says Bradley. “Cohere was willing to engage with us at a much deeper level than other providers, and experiment with us to learn what strategies work in our context.”\\n\\nIn terms of partnership goals, Bradley and team wanted to learn how to keep LLM-powered conversations grounded, factual, and “on the rails,” generating outputs that match enterprise needs in real-life use cases. They also wanted Cohere’s help with training models to enable systems to take specific actions or complete a task.\\n\\n\\n\\nBradley’s team began working with Cohere to improve LivePerson’s own tech support conversational AI system. He says, “The tech support use case is a very sturdy test for LLMs because we’ve got all this conversational data to draw from, and the system needs to provide useful guidance to people about a complicated product. And the results so far have been impressive. Cohere’s models are standing up really well against the big third-party APIs, and they are tuned by real conversational data for our tech support use case, rather than being generic.”\\n\\nThe team trained Cohere models on LivePerson’s own data, and then tested the output with the company’s human contact center agents. “We can train the models more deeply in concert with Cohere than we can with some of the open APIs,” says Bradley.\\n\\nWhen fine-tuning theCohere Commandcore model, Bradley’s team followed a “relaxed training” paradigm and interleaved other data into their dataset in order to avoid overfitting on specific tasks. This enabled the model to maintain its general reasoning capabilities. “Cohere allows us to experiment with paradigms like that that give us the best of both worlds,” he says.\\n\\nThe collaboration has also resulted in some feature improvements. For example, when a customer asks the bot a question, it’s important that the bot pulls the right information from the knowledge base. The team worked with Cohere onre-rankingsearch results from their knowledge base, and then weaving the ranked results into a broader prompt for the LLM to generate an answer to the customer. “It’s not easy to do well, but they did a really nice job. It helped performance and made quite an impact,” says Bradley.\\n\\n\\nLivePerson tech support is now using Cohere models in production, and the team has shifted to working with Cohere on several key use cases for banking and e-commerce clients, including automating specific actions during a conversation. These are currently in the experimental phase, and so far it’s going well. “The Cohere models for banking are performing, again, with very high quality,” Bradley says. “They tend to generate more succinct output than other models, which makes them well-suited for task-based conversations. They are more likely to be factually correct and well-grounded without overindulging themselves in their own language.”LivePerson is also exploring new opportunities for using LLMs in other enterprise AI use cases, such as HR, IT, and industry-specific workflows, for automated customer and employee support. For example, AI assistants can help bank tellers check policy or regulatory requirements, or give sales people quick access to product and service details.For LivePerson’s customer brands, the impact of LLM-powered conversational solutions is massive. Not only does it result in happier customers and employees, but it also allows brands to automate more workflows, save on operational costs, and optimize resources by focusing human staff on higher-value tasks.\\n“Cohere’s models are standing up really well against the big third-party APIs, and they are tuned by real conversational data for our tech support use case, rather than being generic.”\\nREADY TO GET STARTED?\\nCreate an account and build with Cohere\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nDiscord\\nEmail\\n©Cohere2024',\n",

              " 'Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nBlueDot’s intelligence platform empowers public and private sector organizations to rapidly identify, understand, and effectively respond to global infectious disease threats. Combining human and artificial intelligence to track the activity of hundreds of infectious diseases and syndromes worldwide, it applies academic data science and deep subject matter expertise to anticipate global spread and impact. Founded in 2013 and used by the City of Chicago, Taiwan CDC, Air Canada, and more, BlueDot helps clients make critical decisions with clarity and confidence.\\n\\nInfectious diseases pose a growing global threat, as evidenced by recent outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic, the mpox global public health emergency, and an expanding number of avian influenza outbreaks. To prevent health, economic, and social disruption from outbreaks, public and private sector organizations need access to unbiased, accurate, real-time, and global intelligence about disease threats. For more than a decade,BlueDothas generated and disseminated such intelligence through its technology platform. However, until now, it was only accessible via complex API calls tailored to data engineers and data scientists.\\n\\nBlueDot sought to make its insights more accessible and timely while ensuring the highest level of accuracy. Using the fine-tunedCohere ClassifyandCohere Reranksolutions, BlueDot created an interactive platform that makes infectious disease intelligence available to users through natural language.\\n\\nPreviously, tapping into BlueDot’s real-time, infectious disease surveillance data and intelligence required significant technical expertise. Users had to understand which of BlueDot’s many API endpoints – including real-time reports of disease cases, disease spread forecasts, and more – to leverage and structure programmatic calls to the API. This limited adoption to skilled data scientists, engineers, and epidemiologists, creating delays in insight generation and ultimately, real-world action. Dr. Kamran Khan, CEO of BlueDot, explains, “By reducing the technical barriers to interact with a diverse array of complex global data, almost anyone can now generate powerful insights in just a matter of seconds.”\\n\\nBlueDot’s vision was to create a highly accesible solution that empowers users to ask questions in plain language and receive accurate responses instantly. However, translating intricate data queries into precise API calls presented a significant challenge. Initial trials with embedding techniques proved inadequate, failing to discern the subtleties between queries, such as “COVID cases in Italy” and “disease outbreaks in Italy.” To preserve the integrity of insights and client trust, BlueDot needed a system that consistently and reliably identified the most appropriate API endpoint for every user query made in natural language.\\n\\nBlueDot first experimented with embedding-based techniques, but this failed to achieve the necessary level of accuracy, delivering less than a 50% match rate. Then, the BlueDot team found their answer with Cohere, using a fine-tunedCohere ClassifyandCohere Rerank. In production, these endpoints to the Cohere API work in tandem with impressive, low-latency query processing in milliseconds.\\n\\nA fine-tuned Classify first retrieves a list of candidate API endpoints based on the query, then Rerank reorders the candidates to prioritize the most relevant ones. According to BlueDot’s Machine Learning Engineer Nick Gibb, “The integration of Cohere’s technology marked a significant leap in performance. The right endpoint now appears more than 97% of the time.”\\n\\nThis level of accuracy was unachievable with other approaches. This new system captures subtle linguistic nuances that were overlooked by basic embedding techniques, with fast and affordable implementation compared to developing a similar in-house solution. Nick Gibb explains, “Cohere\\'s fine-tuned models were easy to test, going live in less than an hour.”\\n\\nEfforts are ongoing to further refine the system, targeting perfect 100% accuracy. BlueDot employs an evaluation protocol that rigorously assesses the accuracy of fine-tuned Classify and Rerank solutions. This protocol makes sure that the system consistently interprets user queries correctly and reliably directs them to the right data source for accurate responses. It confirms that the system understands user questions well enough to connect them to the data that is needed.\\n\\nA dedicated team handled the Cohere integration, including\\xa0 four software engineers, one product owner, and one product designer. The new system uses BlueDot\\'s data assets, curated and maintained by infectious disease epidemiologists, clinicians, veterinarians, and data scientists.\\n\\nWith Cohere’s custom models in place, BlueDot launched its initial beta trial with its public and private sector clients. BlueDot’s CEO, Dr. Khan noted, “BlueDot’s intelligence informs decisions that impact millions of lives worldwide. This is why our approach to AI development is so rigorous. Cohere is a key partner in helping us make our intelligence more accessible through natural language, while ensuring users are empowered with the specific data they need.\"\\n\\nBy removing technical barriers, BlueDot now enables faster, more effective, and better coordinated organizational responses to global infectious disease threats. Public health agencies, life sciences companies, multinational enterprises, and more can now monitor global threats, understand them faster, and take appropriate actions sooner. What once took days to generate actionable insights now takes minutes, thanks to the broader access to BlueDot’s global intelligence through natural language.\\n\\n\\nCohere remains a valued partner as BlueDot advances the natural language interface to handle multi-turn conversations and queries requiring orchestration across multiple endpoints. Together, BlueDot and Cohere are driving transformational change in how organizations combat, prepare for, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks worldwide.\\n\\n\"Cohere is a key partner in helping us make our intelligence more accessible through natural language, while ensuring users are empowered with the specific data they need.\"\\nREADY TO GET STARTED?\\nCreate an account and build with Cohere\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nDiscord\\nEmail\\n©Cohere2024',\n",

              " \"Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nHyperWrite is a product of Otherside AI. Based in New York City, the team at Otherside AI is dedicated to creating technology that helps the world communicate more effectively. Follow them on Twitter and YouTube, or join the discussion in their Discord community.\\n\\nToday, the blank page is a thing of the past. Generative AI startups are building new and innovative ways to help writers of all kinds create the content they need to achieve their goals. One such pioneer isHyperWrite, a generative AI-powered writing assistant for consumers that makes the process easy and fast.HyperWrite adds autocomplete capabilities to websites and apps, providing users with ideas and suggestions as they type. HyperWrite also enables users to enter prompts and generate complete copy for longer pieces, such as emails, blog posts, business memos, and more.When choosing an LLM for their TypeAhead feature, the HyperWrite team considered several commercial and open-source solutions, as well as building their own. In the end, they chose Cohere’s generative LLM due to its high quality, low latency, and affordability.\\n\\nTo deliver the best possible writing assistant, the startup wanted to build an interface that enabled the average person to interact with, and get value from, large language models (LLMs).The team considered a variety of approaches to integrating LLMs into the HyperWrite platform, including building their own models from scratch or customizing an open-source solution. Matt Shumer, CEO and Co-Founder, says, “There are so many options out there, but at the end of the day, our first priority is our customers. By working with a managed solution like Cohere, we're able to focus our entire effort on our customers — understanding what they need, and building and iterating that for them.”The company tried working with a few managed generative AI solutions before finally settling on Cohere for the long term. The deciding factors: accuracy, affordability, and great support. Shumer says, “Cohere’s models are amazing. The company excels at delivering cost-effective, low-latency, medium-sized models that are high-quality, which enables us to build some of our most difficult-to-implement features that can deliver excellent performance.”\\n\\nHyperWrite is using Cohere’s Command-Light model, which is a great fit for their product. It provides the perfect balance between speed and accuracy, enabling users to generate the output they expected within seconds, whether in the planning, drafting, editing, or iterating process with their piece. When it comes to mitigating risk, Shumer is confident with his team’s approach. “Safety is a reasonable concern, but today’s LLMs have come a long way. Two years ago, you had no clue about what might come out of a model. Now, you have a good sense of how the model will behave.” HyperWrite also uses filtering technology built for social media, adding multiple layers of filters on top of their outputs. Text is not shown to the user until it’s checked, approved, and cleared.So far, Shumer and team have seen very few problems, even with hundreds of thousands of monthly users. He said, “A lot of companies become too risk averse because they don’t realize that it’s possible to constrain things. Our approach has worked well for us and it’s also been easy to implement.”During development, the Cohere team provided valuable technical support that helped the HyperWrite team achieve their goals. When they experienced problems or needed help figuring out a use case, Cohere expertise was right there for them. “That’s a superpower,” said Shumer. “Having Cohere’s team as an extension of ours enables us to do 10 times more, 10 times faster. They’re responsive over Slack, and always willing to try to push through boundaries for us.”\\n\\nHyperWrite is currently in hyper-growth mode, and the pace has been remarkable. “We’re actually outpacing our previous growth percentages and doubling our business every two months,” said Shumer. “And week after week, Cohere enables us to continue delivering at this ever-increasing scale, both from a platform and support perspective. We've worked with a number of vendors, and there's a clear difference in the quality of Cohere’s support, their ability to assist us and help us grow.”By removing the challenges of building their own solution, Cohere enables the startup to do more of what they do best and not worry about things outside of that. “Our entire business is language AI-first,” said Shumer. “It’s one of the most important functions we have to get right. It’s also quite complex and difficult to do, so managed solutions like Cohere help us implement language AI at a reasonable cost and with high quality.”\\n\\nWatchour full interviewwith Matt Shumer to hear more of the HyperWrite story.\\n“Cohere’s models are amazing.

              " \"Introducing Command R+: Our new, most powerful model in the Command R family.\\nTry now\\nFlowrite is a communications platform that uses generative AI to automate copywriting for emails and messages. The company is dedicated to pioneering a better way to write on the web for those whose work depends on building connections. Follow the Flowrite team onTwitterandLinkedIn, or read more about writing, productivity, and the startup journey on theirblog.\\nWriting takes time, effort, and focus — all of which can be hard to muster on any given day. Busy people often don’t have the bandwidth to craft thoughtful communications that help them stay connected and productive. EnterFlowrite, a generative AI platform that helps people stay on top of their communications backlog by drafting emails and messages for them across their web browser.\\nFlowrite is purposely designed for frequent and responsive email and messaging workflows, offering a broad collection of smart email templates for sales, marketing, recruiting, support, and other use cases. But Flowrite is not only for business use; customers also use the service to communicate with friends and family.\\n\\nUnder the hood, Flowrite uses large language models (LLMs) to power its text generation capabilities, and from the beginning, the startup took the managed LLM approach. “We didn’t have the budget for building a model in-house, and we didn’t want to manage the infrastructure,” recalls Bernardo García del Río, AI Lead at Flowrite. “Using an API instead of building and deploying our own model was the most sensible path at that time, and it still makes sense for us.”\\nFlowrite was originally built using OpenAI models, and the AI team was looking to expand their stack to include other LLM solutions in order to boost reliability and unlock new opportunities. They also wanted greater data security for enterprise customers, as well as access to expert technical support to help them achieve their goals faster.\\nGarcía says, “We've been monitoring the LLM landscape from the very beginning, and we thought that Cohere was a clear competitor to OpenAI. And that's why we wanted to start to form a partnership early in the journey.” Not only did Cohere’s models perform well against OpenAI, and in addition, Cohere’s Accelerator program offered the startup access to technical expertise for tailored guidance and support.\\n\\nFlowrite’s primary use case for Cohere was copy generation, and the AI team proceeded to run Cohere’sCommand modelthrough their testing process, focusing on prompt engineering backed by real data to test models for specific tasks. The team looked at a mix of data points from user activity, along with visual output comparison by linguistics experts and company-wide testing. After conducting extensive testing with Command, the AI team was happy with the results and began actively working towards adding it to their production stack.Flowrite has also used Cohere to help them prepare adiverse datasetin order to be able to generate content for a diverse range of topics. The AI team used Cohere'sembeddings modelto cluster data and evaluate the level of diversity of their dataset, so it could help them effectively fine-tune their models and improve latency and quality. “And the results were really good to be honest,” says García. “We found that using Cohere to calculate the distance between the vectors resulted in better clusters compared to OpenAI.”To support these use cases, and more to come, Flowrite relies on Cohere’s technical expertise available through theCohere Accelerator program. Flowrite was one of the first startups to join the program and, in fact, their early feedback helped to shape it.As members, the team can reach out for support anytime on Slack, and gain early access to Beta releases, which helps them plan their roadmap. They also appreciate being closer to Cohere in a collaborative environment where they can give real-world feedback on Cohere products and features. And when Flowrite needs to scale in future, having a good partnership will help the company grow more easily.\\nFor García and his team, getting hands-on with Cohere has been a great experience overall. “Cohere is really easy and straightforward to use,” he says, “In four or five lines of code, you’re generating an email. Cohere is also integrated into popular frameworks like LangChain, as well as the ChromaDB vector database that can automatically create embeddings. It makes things really efficient.”Once testing is complete and the AI team has developed prompts that work well for Cohere, they plan to ship Cohere’s generative models to production. At that point, it will just be a matter of changing a little bit of code. As Flowrite grows its user base of consumers and businesses, they’ll be able to continuously gather more data to further improve model performance across their LLM portfolio.\\n“We've been monitoring the LLM landscape from the very beginning, and we thought that Cohere was a clear competitor to OpenAI. And that's why we wanted to start to form a partnership early in the journey.”\\nREADY TO GET STARTED?\\nCreate an account and build with Cohere\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nDiscord\\nEmail\\n©Cohere2024\",\n",
